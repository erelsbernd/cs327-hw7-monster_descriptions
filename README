I started by changing all the .c files to .cpp files and fixing the compilation errors. I then 
made a MonsterType class that stored the variables of the different monster attributes:
description, name, color, etc. MonsterFactory class was created to do most of the heavy lifting
for reading in the file and parsing the monster attributes. Parsing the file was done by creating
and utilizing separate methods like getNextLine(), getNextWord(), read_in_dice(), and split().
These were called within an overarching while loop in readInMonsterDescriptionsFile(). I used if
else statements and additional while and for loops to check for blank lines, good/bad keywords and
to go through multiple values of an attribute. The MonsterClass method was called from main to
print out the monster descriptions. Overall I think I successfully complete this assignment.
